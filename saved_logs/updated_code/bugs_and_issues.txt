Bugs and Issues:
------------------------------
1.  In the `submitFormData` function, there is a typo in the line where the form data is being sent to the server-side endpoint. The correct line should be `body: JSON.stringify(formData.value)` instead of `body: JSON.stringify(formData)`.

2.  There is no validation for the form fields before submitting them to the server-side endpoint. This can lead to unexpected behavior or errors if the user enters invalid data.

3.  The error message is not cleared when the form submission is successful, which may cause confusion for the user.

4.  The `handleErrors` function logs the error to the console using `console.error(error)`. However, it would be better to display an error message to the user in a more user-friendly way.

5.  There are no checks for network errors when sending the form data to the server-side endpoint. This can lead to unexpected behavior if the network connection is lost.

6.  The `onMounted` lifecycle hook resets the form data without any condition. It would be better to reset the form data only when necessary, such as when the component is re-rendered or when the user navigates away from the page.

7.  The `handleSubmit` function does not handle any errors that may occur during form submission. This can lead to unexpected behavior if an error occurs.

8.  There are no accessibility features implemented in the code. For example, there is no alternative text for the buttons or input fields, which can make it difficult for users with visual impairments to use the form.

Summary of Review:
------------------------------
The updated code addresses the bugs and issues mentioned above. It includes input validation, error handling, and accessibility features. The form submission logic has been improved to handle errors and display a success message to the user. The component structure is consistent with Vue.js best practices, and there are no PEP 8 or Java best practices violations in this code snippet.

Additionally, I added a `form-succeeded` event emitter that can be listened to by parent components to handle the form submission successfully. This allows for more flexibility and reusability of the component.

Overall, the updated code is more robust, maintainable, and follows Vue.js best practices.
