============================================================
Bugs and Issues:
------------------------------
1.  **Missing import statement**: The `button` CSS property is being used in the style, but there's no import statement for the CSS file. This will cause a compilation error.

2.  **Inconsistent unit tests**: There are no unit tests provided for this component. In Vue.js, it's recommended to use Jest or Mocha with Chai for writing unit tests. Without proper testing, we cannot ensure that the component works as expected under different scenarios.

3.  **Potential security risk**: The `background-color` property is set to `#42b983`. If this value can be modified by an attacker, it could potentially lead to a security issue. Consider using a CSS variable or a more secure approach to styling your components.

Summary of Review:
------------------------------
In this review, we've identified a potential bug in the code due to an incomplete import statement. We've also highlighted the importance of writing unit tests for the component to ensure its stability and reliability.

To improve the code, we recommend using CSS variables for styling instead of hardcoding values. This approach makes it easier to manage changes across different components.

Additionally, consider implementing proper testing practices, including unit tests, to ensure that the component works as expected under various scenarios.

The updated code includes a better way of defining the button's background color by using CSS variables, which improves maintainability and reduces potential bugs due to hardcoded values.
