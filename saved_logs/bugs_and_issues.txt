============================================================
Bugs and Issues:
------------------------------
1. **Insecure form submission**: The `handleSubmit` function logs the form data to the console, which is not secure. It should be sent to a server-side endpoint for validation and processing instead.

2. **Lack of input validation**: The code does not validate the form inputs before submitting them. This can lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.

3. **Missing error handling**: The `handleSubmit` function does not handle errors that might occur during form submission. It should be updated to handle potential errors and display informative messages to the user.

4. **Inconsistent naming conventions**: While Vue.js encourages camelCase for variable names, some JavaScript properties (e.g., `type` in the `button` tag) are written in uppercase with underscores (e.g., `_type`). This inconsistency can lead to confusion.

5. **Missing accessibility considerations**: The code does not include any accessibility features, such as ARIA attributes or screen reader-friendly text. This is an important consideration for users with disabilities.

6. **Unused variables and imports**: The `ref` import from Vue.js is not used in this component. Additionally, the `_type` variable in the `button` tag is not necessary and can be removed.

Summary of Review:
------------------------------
The updated code addresses the identified bugs and issues, including insecure form submission, input validation, error handling, naming conventions, accessibility considerations, and unused variables. The `handleSubmit` function now sends the form data to a server-side endpoint for validation and processing, handles errors more robustly, and includes accessibility features like ARIA attributes and screen reader-friendly text. Additionally, the code uses consistent naming conventions and removes unnecessary variables and imports.
